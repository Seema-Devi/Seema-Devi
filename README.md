 # 👋 Hi there, I'm Seema Devi!

## 💡 About Me

I'm an enthusiastic **AI Developer** with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a growing passion for building intelligent, real-world applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). I specialize in using tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **vector databases** to create conversational AI systems and automation solutions.

My journey started with JavaScript, React, and Node.js — and has grown into building powerful tools that combine **Python-based AI backends** with seamless frontend user experiences.

- 🔭 Currently focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM chaining, and AI app deployment.
- 🌱 Learning advanced model evaluation, prompt engineering, and scalable API design.
- 💬 Tech I speak: Python, JavaScript, React, FastAPI, LangChain, Docker.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on LLM-powered applications and AI automation tools.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love exploring the intersection of cooking and technology – both are creative processes that require precision and passion!
